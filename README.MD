<h1>Demo System Tray Electron Application with Hot-Keys</h1>

This application example is based on <a href="https://github.com/sfatihk/electron-tray-window">https://github.com/sfatihk/electron-tray-window</a> however I expose the toggle window feature to allow a hot key (Example CTRL+SHIFT K) to show/hide the Tray Window
